# CAMPO

A web application used to explore and book national parks for camping trips.

## Further Devlopment/Reach Goals:

We hope to build out more features to offer support to our users while on their camping trips.
These include:

- The ability to receive alerts about emergencies within their camping area
- Implementing more extensive articles written about camping, gear, and nature
- The option to book tours through private operators

## The Team

- UX/UI Designers: Christina Benedict & Priscilla Gettins
- Web Developers: Andrew Garcia, Astrid Massuh, Andrew Reardigan, & Priscilla Standard

## Setup

- `git clone` this repo
- `cd` into it.
- `yarn install`

## Available build commands

- `yarn dev`: Runs BOTH your Express.JS and React developer environment locally at the same time. Any logs coming from Express will be prefaced with `[0]`, any logs from `create-react-app` will be prefaced with `[1]`.
- `yarn server`: Runs JUST your Express.JS server.
- `yarn client`: Runs JUST your front-end React app.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view your local React app in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.
